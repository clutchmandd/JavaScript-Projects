### Pizza Menu
This project is a menu to order pizza with a variety of selections of toppings and sizes. It then takes all of the input information and calculates the total price of the order.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first and then the users are off playing the game. Sound effects are used for choosing tiles, a tie game, a lost game, and a winning game.

### Calculator
A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
